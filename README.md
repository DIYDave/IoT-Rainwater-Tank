# IoT-Rainwater-Tank
### IoT Rainwater tank with ESP8266. Web Server &amp; Client, OLED Dispaly, HC-SR04, SPIFFS
This is about a rainwater tank which, thanks to an ESP8266, independently gets the weather data and sends a push message to the smartphone if the current water level in the tank is too high for the expected rainfall.

ESP8266 NodeMCU1.0(ESP12E)
- Act as HTML-5 Web server and manage multiple client tasks
- Sends push notification over Prowl to iOS devices
- Sends data to thingspeak.com
- Measures water level with ultrasonic
- Controls two pumps start / stop over HTML or radio remote control

## ðŸ”¥ New version 2.02 "easy to use" for PlatformIO
Due to the problems with the Arduino IDE and the various libraries, I switched to Visual Studio Code and PlatformIO a few years ago. 
This new variant of the project is based entirely on these tools. 
All required libraries are included in the project. (Folder "lib") the ESP core version can be set to fixed version e.g. v2.4.2
How To: https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode
